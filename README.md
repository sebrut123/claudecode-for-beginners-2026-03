> **Note (local setup only):** If you plan to clone the repository using SSH, make sure to configure your [SSH Keys][gh-conf-ssh-keys] beforehand. Refer to the [troubleshooting guide][gh-troubleshoot-ssh-keys-conf] if you run into issues.

# Exercises and Setup

We'll go over two different exercises where we'll work together with Claude Code to perform programming tasks; the exercises can be carried out locally on your machine or in _GitHub Codespaces_.

# Getting Started

## Fork the Repository

You'll work on your own fork of this repository. To get started, locate the fork button at the top of the repository page, next to _Watch_ and _Star_.

1. Click the Fork button.
2. Make sure your user is selected in the _Owner_ drop-down.
3. Provide a name for the repository or leave as-is.

You may now browse to the new repository under your account.

## Clone or Open the Repository

### Option 1 - Start Codespaces

Once you are on the front page of your forked repository:

1. Click the _Code_ green button which will open up a palette.
2. Select _Codespaces_ and then click on the green button _Create Codespace on main_.

This will open a new tab where your codespace will be bootstrapped — wait for it to finish, and you should then see an editor with the file tree on the left side.

### Option 2 - Clone the Repository

Once you are on the front page of your forked repository:

1. Click on the _Code_ green button which will open a palette.
2. While on the _Local_ tab, _Clone_ using SSH; you may alternatively use the GitHub CLI if you already have set it up.

## Installing Claude Code

Navigate to [Install Claude Code][claude-install] and select the option that suits your platform and workstation configuration.

Once installed, run the following to confirm everything is working:

```bash
claude --version
```

### GitHub Codespaces

Once your codespace is up and running, install the Claude Code extension:

1. Open the Extensions sidebar (_Ctrl+Shift+X_).
2. Search for **Claude Code**.
3. Click **Install**.

# Authenticating

Start Claude Code by:

- *VS Code or Codespaces*: if the tab isn't visible yet, hit _Ctrl+Shift+P_ to show the command palette, then Claude > Open in New Tab.
- *Terminal emulator*: first make sure you are in the directory where you've cloned the repository, then run the command *claude*.

Select the option to authenticate with a Claude subscription and use your account to sign in.

# Exercise #1 - Refactor the Asset Management Application

# Exercise #2 - Create an Application from Scratch
